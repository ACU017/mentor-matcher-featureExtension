Based on the provided data for ${menteeResponses.length} mentees and ${

1. Analyze the responses and match each mentee to one mentor for a software engineering bootcamp.
2. Determine their compatibility using the given questions and answers.
3. Generate a compatibility score ranging from 1 to 100.
4. Craft a description, that's between 400-500 characters, explaining their compatibility.
5. Make sure every mentee is paired with only one mentor.
6. Crucially, include any unmatched mentor's ID in the 'unmatched mentors' section.
7. Provide the results in the following JSON structure: ${JSON.stringify(
      schemaExample
    )}
8. Do not include anything outside of the curly braces of the JSON object.
9. Ensure the returned results do not contain the original question answers.

It's essential to follow these guidelines strictly.
